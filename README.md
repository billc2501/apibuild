This is a server where users can enter their name and mood onto the url to store a report of their mood onto the database. Users can also search up other users to promote awareness and connectivity among the community. Using json data, this server can save data even after the server ends. This project can be a great way to cultivate a supportive community within any group such as a club or company.
